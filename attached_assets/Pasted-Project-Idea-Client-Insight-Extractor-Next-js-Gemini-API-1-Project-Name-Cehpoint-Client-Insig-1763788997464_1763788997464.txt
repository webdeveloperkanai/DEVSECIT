Project Idea: Client Insight Extractor (Next.js + Gemini API)
1. Project Name

Cehpoint Client Insight Engine (CCIE)

2. Core Purpose

A web application where a user uploads a Google Sheet / Excel file containing LinkedIn leads or prospect data.
The backend uses Google Gemini API to analyze and generate a structured output:

Identify ideal clients

Provide three approach suggestions per person

Create personalized conversation starters

Output format mirrors the one you received earlier.

This tool is meant for Cehpoint’s marketing interns to speed up B2B outreach preparation.

3. Technology Stack
Frontend

Next.js 15 (App Router)

React Server Components

TailwindCSS for styling

File upload form built with UploadThing or native Next.js file API

Backend

Next.js Server Actions / API Routes

Gemini API (Google Generative AI for Developers)

Node.js XLSX parser (xlsx npm package) for reading Excel/Google Sheet exports

Output generation logic orchestrated in the backend

Storage (optional)

Temporary file storage via edge-compatible in-memory buffer

Or Supabase Storage for logged audit trails

4. Core Features (Minimal, Only What You Need)
Feature 1: File Upload (Excel/CSV)

User uploads a dataset containing:

name

role

company

location

description

etc.

Backend automatically parses it using xlsx or CSV parser.

Feature 2: Gemini-Driven Insight Generation

Backend sends structured JSON extracted from the sheet to Gemini with this instruction:

Identify ideal clients

Generate 3 pitch suggestions for each person

Write one conversation starter for each person

Return results in a consistent structured JSON format

Feature 3: Output Formatting

The returned structured JSON is transformed into a clean UI output:

Example:

[
  {
    "name": "Deepak Kumar",
    "role": "Co-Founder & CTO",
    "suggestions": [...],
    "conversation_starter": "..."
  }
]

Feature 4: Downloadable Report

A button generates a PDF or DOCX report containing:

Client insights

Pitches

Conversation starters

For interns to send or review.

5. User Flow

User visits /upload

Upload Excel/CSV

Backend parses → sends structured data to Gemini

Gemini responds with insight JSON

UI displays structured results

User can download PDF or copy the results

For each person:
1. Identify whether he/she is an ideal client for software development or cybersecurity services.
